# Overview
Reports API allows to download call data records (CDRs). Records can be queried using a variety of parameters such as origin and destination phone numbers, status, time period, etc. (see report filters for more information). It is also possible to include the message body/text and to download reports for any of your subaccounts.

Use case examples:

* Customer billing - download your transactions and use the included price data to determine what to bill your customers
* Invoice reconciliation - compare your usage data with the invoice you have received
* Monitoring & analytics - Add CDR data to your business intelligence or analytics system to correlate it with other events

## Features

- Variety of filters - query exactly the data you need
- Compressed CSV - Reports are formatted as CSV and compressed for faster downloads
- Privacy - Report files are automatically deleted after 72 hours
- Callbacks - An HTTP(S) POST callback can be generated to notify when report is completed

## Performance considerations

Be advised, even though the Reports API Beta is quite fast and can deal with enormous amounts of data, it may seem to be slow when trying to download data for realtime analytics. Usage of filters can speed up processing considerably.
